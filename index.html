 <h1>Database Concepts</h1>
    </header>
 <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>Data are the collection of raw facts and figures which are unorganized, uninterpreted, and isolated, which doesnâ€™t give any particular sense. They are randomly gathered so that they can be processed to obtain the desired result.</p>
 <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>Information is the processed form of data. Information gives a meaningful result after data are interpreted. For example:</p>
            <p><strong>Ram</strong>, 17 year old and lives in <strong>Pokhara</strong> 18.</p>
  <h2>DBMS (Database Management System)</h2>
            <p>DBMS is a computerized record-keeping system. It is a software that defines, manipulates, and manages the database. It allows users to access files, update records, and retrieve data as requested.</p>
   <h3>Advantages of DBMS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharing Data</li>
                <li>Reduce Data Redundancy</li>
                <li>Data Backup and Recovery</li>
                <li>Data Security</li>
                <li>Multiple User Interface</li>
                <li>Data Integrity</li>
            </ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Expensive</li>
                <li>Changing Technology</li>
                <li>Backup is needed</li>
            </ul>

<h2>Database Models</h2>
<h3>Hierarchical Database Model</h3>
            <p>This is one of the oldest database models, where data is represented in the form of records organized in a tree-like structure.</p>

<h3>Network Database Model</h3>
            <p>The network model was designed to address the limitations of the hierarchical model by allowing many-to-many relationships.</p>
<h3>Relational Database Model</h3>
            <p>In this model, data are organized into tables that contain rows and columns, also known as relations. It is the most common database model used today.</p>
 <h2>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2>
            <p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and managing data in a database. It includes sub-languages such as DDL, DML, and DCL.</p>
<h2>Normalization</h2>
            <p>Normalization is the process of breaking down complex relations into simpler relations to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.</p>
            <h3>First Normal Form (1NF)</h3>
            <p>1NF eliminates duplicate columns and ensures each table has a primary key.</p>
            <h3>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h3>
            <p>2NF removes partial dependencies by placing data that applies to multiple rows in separate tables.</p>
            <h3>Third Normal Form (3NF)</h3>
            <p>3NF removes columns that are not dependent on the primary key and ensures that data is fully normalized.</p>
